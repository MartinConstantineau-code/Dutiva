This page covers the two core HR record-keeping modules — **Employees** and **Cases** — and the data boundary layer that connects them to production persistence. Both modules follow the platform's dual-mode architecture: a fixture-driven **demo mode** renders rich prototype data for Northgate scenarios, while **production mode** reads/writes real Supabase tables behind RLS-scoped APIs.

## Routing & Mode Dispatch

Both modules register route entries in `appViews.tsx` without a `gated()` wrapper — they dispatch on workspace mode internally.

| Route                        | Lazy component        | Comment                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `/app/employees`             | `EmployeesView`       | [src/app/appViews.tsx:85]() |
| `/app/employees/:employeeId` | `EmployeeProfileView` | [src/app/appViews.tsx:86]() |
| `/app/cases`                 | `CasesView`           | [src/app/appViews.tsx:81]() |
| `/app/cases/:caseId`         | `CaseDetailView`      | [src/app/appViews.tsx:82]() |

Each top-level component checks `useWorkspaceMode().mode` and renders either the demo or production variant:

```
// EmployeesView — src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.tsx:28-30
if (workspaceMode === 'production') return <EmployeesProductionView />
return <EmployeesDemoView />
```

## Employees Module

### EmployeesView (Demo)

`EmployeesDemoView` renders the Northgate fixture employees from `@/data` as a roster with a People/Org-chart segmented control. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.tsx:33-37]()

Key features:

- **Segmented control**: `list` mode shows the table roster; `org` mode renders `OrgChart`. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.tsx:37]()
- **Filter**: case-insensitive substring match on name, role, or province (localized). [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.tsx:43-50]()
- **Roster table** (desktop) and **stacked cards** (phone) — both in the DOM, toggled via CSS. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.tsx:114-115]()
- **Ask Advisor** sparkle button per row — calls `useAskAdvisorAboutEmployee()` hook. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.tsx:56-59]()
- Row click navigates to `/app/employees/${e.id}`. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.tsx:55]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.tsx:33-108]()

- **Error/retry** banner for load failures. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesProductionView.tsx:129-139]()
- **`ProductionEmptyState`** when no `organizationId`. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesProductionView.tsx:76-78]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesProductionView.tsx:48-283]()

### OrgChart

`OrgChart` renders in demo mode when the user selects the "Org chart" tab. It builds a reporting-line tree from `orgStructure` and `orgRoot` fixture data. [src/features/app/views/employees/OrgChart.tsx:47]()

- Displays **manager/report stat tiles** (counts). [src/features/app/views/employees/OrgChart.tsx:53-54]()
- Shows an **Advisor reporting-line watch** gold banner when a manager is offboarding. [src/features/app/views/employees/OrgChart.tsx:58-64]()
- Renders the workspace root node and one visual column per `OrgBranchNode` (manager → reports). [src/features/app/views/employees/OrgChart.tsx:97-169]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeDrawer.tsx:1-117]()

### EmployeeProfileView

The employee profile hub has eight tabs, three of which are role-restricted (marked `locked`).

| Tab          | Component                 | Locked |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------ |
| overview     | `EmployeeOverviewTab`     | No     |

| compliance   | `EmployeeComplianceTab`   | No     |
| cases        | `EmployeeCasesTab`        | No     |

Tab definitions at [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileView.tsx:50-59](). Tab bodies are pure renderers in `employeeProfileTabs.tsx`. [src/features/app/views/employees/employeeProfileTabs.tsx:1-29]()

**Demo mode** (`EmployeeProfileDemoView`) resolves employee/detail from fixtures, composes a timeline, maps the governing statute per jurisdiction (`STATUTES` map), and pins the employee as the Advisor's workspace context via `setContext(contextFromEmployee(...))`. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileView.tsx:91-113]()

Deep-link support: other modules navigate here with `{ tab: 'compensation' }` in router state. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileView.tsx:73-82]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileView.tsx:40-59](), [src/features/app/views/employees/employeeProfileTabs.tsx:81-153]()

### EmployeeProfileProductionView

The production profile renders a single `public.employees` row with several sub-records loaded in parallel. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileProductionView.tsx:91]()

Parallel load on mount via `Promise.all`:

```
[employee, notes, cases, expiryRecords, leaves, tasks]
```

[src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileProductionView.tsx:124-132]()

Sections:

- **Facts header** with initials avatar, name, title, province, start date. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileProductionView.tsx:91-95]()

- **Expiry records** (certifications & dated documents) — add/remove via `hr_expiry_records`. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileProductionView.tsx:107-110]()
- **Leave records** — add/end leave via `hr_leaves`, status-only (never medical detail). [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileProductionView.tsx:113-117]()
- **Open cases** for this employee filtered from `listCases`. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileProductionView.tsx:139]()
- **Notes thread** — `hr_employee_notes` with add-note composer. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileProductionView.tsx:104]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeeProfileProductionView.tsx:91-195]()

### useAskAdvisorAboutEmployee

A hook returning a callback `(emp: Employee) => void` that opens the `AdvisorRail` with the employee's insight line and risk-flag card. If a risk flag has a backing `chatId`, the "Open full case" action navigates to `/app/advisor`. [src/features/app/views/employees/useAskAdvisorAboutEmployee.ts:14-55]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/employees/useAskAdvisorAboutEmployee.ts:14-55]()

---

## Cases Module

### CasesView (Demo)

`CasesDemoView` lists cases from the `caseModel.ts` in-memory store (fixture + session-created). [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesView.tsx:30]()

- Shows open-count header and a **New case** button. [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesView.tsx:52-63]()
- Each case card renders title, type/province/owner/opened meta, status chip, summary, and step-progress bar. [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesView.tsx:67-106]()
- Row click navigates to `/app/cases/:caseId`. [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesView.tsx:39]()
- "New case" opens `NewCaseModal`; on create, prepends, navigates to detail, and toasts. [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesView.tsx:42-47]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesView.tsx:24-116]()

### CasesProductionView

`CasesProductionView` reads from `public.hr_cases` (migration 0007). Loads both cases and the employee roster for cross-referencing. [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesProductionView.tsx:62]()

- **Create case form** with title, case type (Termination/Performance/Accommodation/Onboarding), employee (linked from real roster), province, and due date. [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesProductionView.tsx:173-278]()
- **Inline status change** via dropdown per row. [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesProductionView.tsx:118-126]()
- **Remove case** button per row. [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesProductionView.tsx:128-136]()
- Employee name resolution from the loaded roster. [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesProductionView.tsx:98-99]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/cases/CasesProductionView.tsx:62-352]()

### CaseDetailView (Demo)

`CaseDetailDemoView` renders a rich case workspace with five tabs:

| Tab key    | Component         | Content                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `overview` | `CaseOverviewTab` | Summary, Advisor recommendation, risk assessment, workflow steps, timeline, people involved, approvals, linked tasks, documents, compliance flags |
| `risk`     | `CaseRiskTab`     | Six-axis risk review (coverage, notice, documentation, consistency, retaliation, cost/timeline)                                                   |
| `legal`    | `CaseLegalTab`    | Legal review record (counsel, scope, retention, outcome)                                                                                          |

| `notes`    | `CaseNotesTab`    | Private notes composer with ⌘↵ save shortcut                                                                                                      |

Tab bodies are pure renderers in `caseDetailTabs.tsx`. [src/features/app/views/cases/caseDetailTabs.tsx:28]()

The demo view uses case-type–driven risk/recommendation lookup via `caseRiskByType`, `caseRecommendationByType`, and `caseRiskAxesByType` from `@/data`; non-fixture types fall back to pending state. [src/features/app/views/cases/CaseDetailView.tsx:161-166]()

Workspace context is pinned when a case opens (`setContext(contextFromEmployee(emp, caze.typeLabel, 'case'))`). [src/features/app/views/cases/CaseDetailView.tsx:148-150]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/cases/CaseDetailView.tsx:65-186](), [src/features/app/views/cases/caseDetailTabs.tsx:81-184]()

### CaseDetailProductionView

Renders a single `public.hr_cases` row with facts header, inline status select, and a `hr_case_notes` thread. [src/features/app/views/cases/CaseDetailProductionView.tsx:48]()

Load sequence: `Promise.all([getCase(caseId), listCaseNotes(caseId)])`, followed by employee name resolution. [src/features/app/views/cases/CaseDetailProductionView.tsx:65-66]()

State machine: `loading | ready | missing | failed`. [src/features/app/views/cases/CaseDetailProductionView.tsx:57]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/cases/CaseDetailProductionView.tsx:48-250]()

### NewCaseModal

The demo-mode intake modal for creating cases. [src/features/app/views/cases/NewCaseModal.tsx:30]()

Fields:

- **Case type** — 12 options from `newCaseTypes` in `caseModel.ts`. [src/features/app/views/cases/caseModel.ts:153-172]()
- **Employee** — from fixture list, or "No specific employee" for workplace-wide cases. [src/features/app/views/cases/NewCaseModal.tsx:124-136]()
- **Jurisdiction** — 5 options (Ontario, Quebec, BC, Alberta, Federal). [src/features/app/views/cases/caseModel.ts:175-181]()
- **Title** (optional) — falls back to `{type} — {employee}`. [src/features/app/views/cases/caseModel.ts:237-241]()

Sensitive case types display a gold lock banner: Termination, Discipline, Harassment/workplace investigation, Complaint, Compensation review. [src/features/app/views/cases/caseModel.ts:184-190]()

Uses `buildCreatedCase()` to produce a `WorkspaceCase` with intake-stage defaults. [src/features/app/views/cases/caseModel.ts:233-264]()

Sources: [src/features/app/views/cases/NewCaseModal.tsx:30-204](), [src/features/app/views/cases/caseModel.ts:153-264]()

### caseModel.ts

The view-model layer for the case workspace. Key exports:

## Production API Boundary Layer

Each module has a `productionApi.ts` file that forms the data boundary between the UI and Supabase. All follow the same contract:

1. **Zod-validated rows** — every row from Supabase passes through a `z.object(...)` schema before reaching the UI.
2. **Throws on failure** — unlike the workspace-mode API which degrades silently, these APIs throw on error since they only run for signed-in admins.
3. **`supabase` null guard** — every function starts with `if (!supabase) throw new Error('Supabase is not configured')`.
4. **camelCase mapping** — a `toX()` function converts snake_case DB rows to camelCase TypeScript interfaces.

## Database Schema

Six tables underpin the employees and cases modules. All use `organization_id` FK for multi-tenancy, RLS via `is_org_member()` (SELECT) and `is_org_admin()` (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), and UUID primary keys.

### RLS Pattern

All tables use the same RLS posture:

```sql
-- SELECT: any active org member
USING (public.is_org_member(organization_id, (select auth.uid())))

-- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: org owners/admins only
WITH CHECK (public.is_org_admin(organization_id, (select auth.uid())))
```

`hr_case_notes` denormalizes `organization_id` from the parent case to avoid joins in RLS policies, a pattern documented in migration 0009. [supabase/migrations/0009_add_hr_case_notes.sql:6-8]()

Key design decisions:

- `hr_cases.employee_id` is **SET NULL** on employee deletion — a case file may outlive the employment record. [supabase/migrations/0007_add_hr_cases.sql:15]()
- `hr_case_notes` and `hr_employee_notes` **CASCADE** on parent deletion. [supabase/migrations/0009_add_hr_case_notes.sql:12]()
- `hr_leaves.leave_type` is unconstrained text — leave taxonomies vary by jurisdiction. [supabase/migrations/0065_add_hr_leaves.sql:7-8]()

Sources: [supabase/migrations/0006_add_employees.sql:1-49](), [supabase/migrations/0007_add_hr_cases.sql:1-45](), [supabase/migrations/0009_add_hr_case_notes.sql:1-33](), [supabase/migrations/0010_add_hr_employee_notes.sql:1-29](), [supabase/migrations/0064_add_hr_expiry_records.sql:1-49](), [supabase/migrations/0065_add_hr_leaves.sql:1-47](), [supabase/migrations/0066_add_employee_lifecycle_dates.sql:1-18]()

## Fixture Data Layer

In demo mode, both modules read from `src/data/` fixtures.

### Employee Fixtures

The `Employee` type defines: id, name, initials, role (Bi), dept (Bi), province (Bi), status (Bi), tone, tenure (Bi), insight (Bi), and an optional `EmployeeRiskFlag` with tone/title/body/chatId. [src/data/types.ts:59-73]()

`EmployeeDetail` adds salary, band, market rate, manager, start date, timeline events, document keys, case ids, and leave records. [src/data/types.ts:98-114]()

`OrgBranch` defines reporting branches for the org chart (managerId, dept, reportIds). [src/data/types.ts:117-121]()

### Case Fixtures

`CaseFile` defines: id, title (Bi), type (CaseType union), empId, province, status, tone, owner, due, retention, chatId, summary, and workflow steps. [src/data/types.ts:159-181]()

`CaseRisk` has level/levelLabel/tone/factors. `CaseRiskAxis` covers the six risk review dimensions. `CaseNote` has text/author/time. [src/data/types.ts:183-204]()

- Org chart tab renders stats and the reporting-line watch note. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.test.tsx:46-63]()
- Ask Advisor opens the rail with the employee insight and risk card. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.test.tsx:73-93]()

**Production mode tests:**

- Render employees from a mocked `supabase.from('employees')` chain. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.test.tsx:97-104]()
- Add employee via the inline form. [src/features/app/views/employees/EmployeesView.test.tsx:106-122]()

### productionApi Unit Tests

**employees/productionApi.test.ts**: Validates `listEmployees` returns camel-cased rows scoped to org, `addEmployee` nulls empty optionals, `removeEmployee` deletes by id, `getEmployee` returns null for missing IDs, and `updateEmployeeStatus`/note operations work correctly. [src/features/app/views/employees/productionApi.test.ts:1-153]()

**cases/productionApi.test.ts**: Validates listing, adding, status updates, removal, case notes, and open-case counting. Same per-test mock pattern: `vi.doMock('@/lib/supabaseClient')` + `vi.resetModules()` + dynamic `import('./productionApi')`. [src/features/app/views/cases/productionApi.test.ts:1-45]() (referenced from pre-read file list)

**tasks/productionApi.test.ts**: Validates listing (with `done` derivation), adding, toggling done/open, and counting open tasks. [src/features/app/views/tasks/productionApi.test.ts:1-118]()

## Supporting Components

### RiskFlagCard

A reusable card rendering an employee's risk flag with tone-styled border, dot, title, body, and action buttons. Used by both `EmployeeOverviewTab` and `EmployeeDrawer`. [src/features/app/views/employees/RiskFlagCard.tsx:26-59]()

Props: `tone`, `title` (LText), `body` (LText), and optional `actions` array of `RiskFlagAction` (label + onClick + optional primary flag). [src/features/app/views/employees/RiskFlagCard.tsx:13-24]()

### Chip Utilities

Both modules use shared chip class helpers from `@/components/chips`:

- `statusChipClass(tone)` — for status badges (e.g., Active, Offboarding, Open, Resolved)
- `sourceChipClass(tone)` — for source/category chips (e.g., timeline source labels, org chart department)
- `dotToneClass(tone)` — for small status dots
