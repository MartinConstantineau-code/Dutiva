# Dutiva Web — documentation index

This index exists so the documents that matter are found by someone who
doesn't already know they exist — start with **Canonical facts**, which
outranks every other document in this folder on any question of fact.

Repo-root entry points: [README.md](../README.md) (what the project is and how
to run it), [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) (AI coding agents start here),
[CONVENTIONS.md](../CONVENTIONS.md) (full engineering conventions).

## Platform wiki (architecture map)

| Document                         | What it settles                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [wiki/README.md](wiki/README.md) | **In-repo mirror** of the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/Dutiva-Canada/Dutiva_Web/wiki) — how to sync, and how this folder relates to `docs/`. |
| [wiki/Home.md](wiki/Home.md)     | Platform overview: three surfaces, tech stack, module index. Start here for the big picture.                                                     |

The wiki is copied from `Dutiva_Web.wiki` via `npm run wiki:sync`. Edit the GitHub wiki (or this mirror and `npm run wiki:sync -- --push`), then sync into the main repo when publishing.

| Document                                             | What it settles                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [CANONICAL_FACTS.md](CANONICAL_FACTS.md)             | **Source of record for every load-bearing fact** — counts, pricing, jurisdictions, company details, and the claims that must not be made. Read before writing any customer-facing or investor-facing number. |
| [NATURAL_LANGUAGE_COPY.md](NATURAL_LANGUAGE_COPY.md) | **How we write** — natural, human prose for marketing and app UI; AI-tell ban list; draft → revise checklist. Does not override CANONICAL_FACTS on claims.                                                   |
| [BRAND.md](BRAND.md)                                 | **How we look** — the colour system (navy/charcoal/ivory foundation, teal interactive accent, champagne executive accent), theme rules, and the BusinessTech direction the brand carries.                    |

Its rule — _where this file disagrees with the code, the code wins_ — is
enforced by `npm run check`, in two halves: `src/canonicalFacts.test.ts` for
the rows backed by TypeScript values, and `scripts/check-canonical-facts.mjs`
(`npm run check:facts`) for the brand rows, which live in CSS that Vitest
cannot read. Adding a code-backed fact means adding its check.

## What is still open

| Document                                                       | What it settles                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [TODO.md](TODO.md)                                             | Every open item, swept from the "still staged" / "not done" notes in PRs #1–#132 and the docs below. Separates owner actions (a secret, a filing) from decisions, blockers and build work. |
| [DEVIN_PROMPTS.md](DEVIN_PROMPTS.md)                           | The delegable half of `TODO.md`, written as fourteen self-contained agent prompts — plus the owner actions that no agent can close, and why.                                               |
| [EMPTY_WORKSPACE_ONBOARDING.md](EMPTY_WORKSPACE_ONBOARDING.md) | First-run guidance for empty production workspaces: Home checklist + empty→create; what is in/out of v1; proposed EN/FR copy.                                                              |
| [LEGAL_REVIEW_INVENTORY.md](LEGAL_REVIEW_INVENTORY.md)         | Every document a legal reviewer must see, counted and sized per bucket — the RFQ-ready inventory for quoting lawyer / HR-consultant review, with sequencing.                               |

Each PR here records what it did not do. `TODO.md` is where those notes
accumulate — add to it when a PR leaves something open, and delete the entry
when the thing is done. `DEVIN_PROMPTS.md` is derived from it and goes stale
the moment an item closes; when you close one, delete its prompt too.

## What is true, and how we keep it true

Dutiva is a compliance product, so a wrong fact is a product defect. These
govern what the product is allowed to assert.

| [AI_USAGE_STRATEGY.md](AI_USAGE_STRATEGY.md)                                   | Where an LLM is used and where it deliberately is not — "the LLM proposes, deterministic code disposes". Statutory clauses, notice math and crisis text are never model-authored.                    |

| [LAW_MONITORING.md](LAW_MONITORING.md)                                         | How law-change monitoring works, the 2026-07-30 coverage audit, and why sweeping a page is not detecting an amendment on it.                                                                         |

## Design handoffs

Feature work is driven by high-fidelity handoffs, committed alongside the code
they produced (AGENTS.md § Design handoffs):

- [design-handoff-hr-documents-library/](design-handoff-hr-documents-library/) — Document Studio, template detail, repository, generate wizard.
- [design-handoff-advisor-chat/](design-handoff-advisor-chat/) — Advisor response experience, memory, engineering roadmap. Its `AGENT.md` is the contract for how the Advisor communicates.

## Adding a document

Add the file, then add its row here — an unlisted document is one nobody
finds. If it asserts a fact that also lives in code, say which file wins and
add the check alongside the others (`src/canonicalFacts.test.ts`, or
`scripts/check-canonical-facts.mjs` if the value lives in CSS).
