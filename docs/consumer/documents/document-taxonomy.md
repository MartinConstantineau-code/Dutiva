# Document Taxonomy

## Purpose

This document defines the categories of consumer document templates. The exact catalogue for each jurisdiction is defined separately. This taxonomy provides the organizing structure.

---

## Taxonomy rules

`DTAX-REQ-001`: Every document template SHALL belong to exactly one category.

`DTAX-REQ-002`: Categories SHALL be stable across releases; renaming a category requires a migration plan for saved documents.

`DTAX-REQ-003`: A template SHALL declare the jurisdictions it supports and SHALL NOT be offered for unsupported jurisdictions.

`DTAX-REQ-004`: A template SHALL declare a risk level (`low`, `medium`, `high`) and a review status.

`DTAX-REQ-005`: Prohibited document categories SHALL be clearly identified and SHALL require professional-review workflows before any template can be offered.

- wills, powers of attorney, trusts, or estate documents;
