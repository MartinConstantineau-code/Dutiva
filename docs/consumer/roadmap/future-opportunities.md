# Future Opportunities

## Purpose

This document lists longer-term opportunities for the consumer product family. None of these are committed scope. They are ideas to consider once the core platform is stable, legally reviewed, and trusted by users.

## Risks to monitor

| Opportunity                              | Risk                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Estate, immigration, tax, health domains | High regulated-professional exposure; requires careful scope boundaries.             |
| Municipality coverage                    | Fragmented sources, rapid changes, many edge cases.                                  |
| E-signing / certified delivery           | Vendor lock-in, legal validity questions across jurisdictions.                       |
| Professional-review marketplace          | Potential to be seen as referral fee / unauthorized practice; requires legal review. |
| Government account linking               | OAuth scope, privacy terms, data-residency, and reliability risks.                   |
| AI predictive assistance                 | Could feel intrusive or create liability if recommendations are wrong.               |
| Enterprise white-label                   | Brand dilution and boundary confusion with professional services.                    |

## Evaluation criteria for future opportunities

Before any future opportunity moves from this list to the roadmap, it must be evaluated against:

1. **Trust impact** — does it strengthen or weaken user trust?
2. **Legal exposure** — does it risk unauthorized practice, privacy, or consumer-protection issues?
3. **Knowledge maintenance burden** — can the knowledge base be kept current and reviewed?
4. **Technical feasibility** — can it be built securely and maintainably?
5. **Market need** — is there genuine consumer demand?
6. **Differentiation** — does it leverage the platform's moat (Canadian jurisdiction graph, source provenance, evidence graph, bilingual support)?
