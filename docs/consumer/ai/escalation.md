# Escalation

## Purpose

Escalation ensures that users are directed to qualified professionals or emergency services when a situation is beyond what the product can safely handle. The product escalates while still helping — it does not simply punt.

## Escalation categories

| Category                          | When it applies                                                                                                    | Destination                                                                                                  | Product behaviour                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crisis / emergency**            | Imminent risk of harm to self or others; medical emergency; immediate danger.                                      | 9-1-1, 9-8-8, crisis lines, emergency services.                                                              | Stop administrative guidance; show crisis resources; offer to contact emergency services if technically possible.                                                     |
| **Legal complexity**              | High-stakes legal matter; potential litigation; rights in dispute; multi-jurisdiction conflict.                    | Employment lawyer, tenant advocate, family lawyer, immigration lawyer, civil litigator, legal aid clinic.    | Explain why a professional is needed; preserve next steps; suggest what documents/evidence to gather; offer to generate a referral-request or records-request letter. |
| **Regulated professional advice** | Tax, immigration, financial planning, insurance underwriting, estate administration, regulated health professions. | Accountant, immigration consultant, financial planner, insurance broker, estate lawyer, health professional. | Flag the boundary; provide general information only; recommend professional; avoid specific advice.                                                                   |
| **Government filing / tribunal**  | A document must be filed with a court, tribunal, or government body; deadlines have passed or are imminent.        | Relevant tribunal, government office, ombudsman, or lawyer.                                                  | Provide procedural orientation and deadlines (where sourced); recommend professional or direct filing assistance; do not imply the product can file for the user.     |
| **Jurisdiction uncertainty**      | The system cannot determine which jurisdiction applies or jurisdictions conflict.                                  | User must confirm; if high-stakes, recommend a professional.                                                 | Ask clarifying questions; offer jurisdiction-neutral guidance; flag if the matter is too uncertain to proceed safely.                                                 |
| **AI confidence too low**         | The model is unsure and cannot ground its answer in vetted knowledge.                                              | Human review or professional.                                                                                | State the uncertainty clearly; do not present a fabricated answer; recommend verification or professional help.                                                       |

## Escalation UX

`AI-REQ-070`: Escalation SHALL be communicated clearly and calmly, without alarming the user unnecessarily.

`AI-REQ-071`: Every escalation message SHALL:

- state the reason for escalation;
- explain what the product will and will not do next;
- provide safe, immediate next steps the user can take;
- suggest the type of professional or service to contact;
- include relevant resources (e.g., legal aid finder, tenant hotline, crisis line) where available.

`AI-REQ-072`: Escalation SHALL be presented as a helpful boundary, not as a refusal. For example: "This situation may affect your legal rights, so a lawyer is the right person to assess it. While you arrange that, here are steps you can take now to protect your position."

`AI-REQ-073`: The system SHALL allow the user to save their situation, evidence, and generated drafts before leaving the product to contact a professional.

---

## Escalation in document generation

`CDG-REQ-048`: The system SHALL refuse to generate a document and escalate when:

- the template is in a prohibited category (e.g., court pleadings, notarized documents);
- the user's answers indicate high legal risk (e.g., fraud allegations, threatened litigation);
- the required professional review has not been acknowledged;
- the document must be filed with a court, tribunal, or government body.

`CDG-REQ-049`: The refusal SHALL explain why, suggest alternatives (e.g., records request, professional referral letter), and offer to connect with the Evidence Locker to organize supporting material.

---

## Escalation in evidence handling

`PEL-REQ-075`: The system SHALL escalate when evidence analysis suggests:

- criminal activity or fraud;
- safety risk;
- imminent legal deadline that has passed;
- need for a regulated professional (e.g., forensic accountant, lawyer).

`PEL-REQ-076`: The system SHALL NOT claim that stored evidence will be admissible in court or sufficient to win a dispute.

---

## Professional referral information

`AI-REQ-074`: The system MAY provide general guidance on how to find a qualified professional (e.g., law society referral service, legal aid, tenant advocacy groups, provincial/territorial consumer protection offices). It SHALL NOT recommend a specific paid service or individual unless independently vetted.

`AI-REQ-075`: The system SHALL clearly distinguish between public services (legal aid, government offices, hotlines) and private professionals.

## When escalation is optional vs. mandatory

| Mandatory escalation                              | Optional recommendation                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Crisis/emergency signals                          | Complex but manageable consumer complaint     |
| Prohibited document category                      | High-dollar dispute where a lawyer could help |
| Litigation or threatened litigation               | Cross-border move with tax implications       |
| Past or imminent statutory deadline               | Unclear jurisdiction but low stakes           |
| Allegations of crime, fraud, or safety violations | User simply says "I want to talk to a lawyer" |

`AI-REQ-076`: Mandatory escalations SHALL block the action that triggered them. Optional recommendations SHALL be presented clearly but SHALL NOT block the user from continuing if they understand the limitation.

---

## Logging and review

`AI-REQ-077`: Every escalation event SHALL be logged with the trigger category, the action taken, and the user-facing message, without storing PII.

`AI-REQ-078`: Escalation patterns SHALL be reviewed periodically to ensure the rules are neither over- nor under-escalating.
