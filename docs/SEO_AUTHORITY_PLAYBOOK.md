# SEO authority playbook — listings, citations, and links

The companion to [SEO_GEO_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./SEO_GEO_IMPLEMENTATION.md).
That document covers everything the build controls: prerendering, metadata,
structured data, sitemap, robots. **This one covers the part the repository
cannot do**, and says so plainly rather than pretending otherwise.

## Why this document is not code

As of this writing, a live search for the brand plus its core category returns
Dutiva's **legal pages** — privacy, terms, Quebec Law 25, PIPEDA, cookies, AI
usage disclosure — and not the homepage, `/pricing`, `/guides`, or `/blog`.
The commercial terms are held by established competitors with large content
libraries and years of accumulated links.

That result is diagnostic. It proves crawling, indexing, and rendering all
work correctly — the technical layer is not the problem. It also shows what
is missing: the policy documents rank because they are long, unique, and
substantive, while the site as a whole has close to no external authority.
Two levers move that, and neither is a code change:

1. **Depth on the pages meant to rank.** Partly addressed — the twelve
   editorial articles were expanded from roughly 550 to 850–1,600 English
   words each, bilingually, and every article now links into `/templates`
   and `/pricing`.
2. **Links and citations from sites that already have authority.** Entirely
   human outreach. That is what follows.

Nothing here can be shipped by an agent. Treat it as a work queue for a
person, ordered so the cheapest, highest-certainty items come first.

## Tier 1 — Owned listings (do these first)

These are free, fully within your control, and each produces a citation that
search engines and answer engines both read. None requires anyone's approval.

| Listing                 | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Use the **exact positioning line** from `src/seo/site.ts` (`ORG_DESCRIPTION`)
so every listing agrees with the site and with the JSON-LD. Consistency across
listings is itself a ranking and trust signal — divergent descriptions are
worse than a shorter one repeated verbatim.

### Ready-to-paste copy

Derived from `ORG_DESCRIPTION` and `docs/CANONICAL_FACTS.md`. Do not improve
these ad hoc; change `site.ts` and re-derive, or the listings drift the way
the Drive documents did.

#### Short (under 100 characters), EN

> AI-assisted HR compliance software for Canadian employers.

#### Short, FR

> Logiciel de conformité RH assisté par l'IA pour les employeurs canadiens.

#### Medium (about 250 characters), EN

> Dutiva Canada Inc. provides AI-assisted HR compliance software for Canadian
> employers — practical, jurisdiction-specific guidance and workplace
> documentation across the employee lifecycle. Dutiva does not provide legal
> advice.

#### Long, EN

> Dutiva is compliance-oriented HR software built for Canadian employers, HR
> teams, and business operators. It provides jurisdiction-specific guidance and
> review-ready workplace documentation across Ontario, Quebec, and the federal
> labour regime, covering the employee lifecycle from hiring through
> termination. Dutiva names the statute, not just the province. It supports HR
> workflows and documentation; it does not provide legal advice and does not
> make employment decisions for its customers.

**Category selections.** Where a directory asks for a category, prefer "HR
software" or "compliance software" over "legal services" — the latter
misrepresents the product and cuts against the boundary the site maintains
everywhere else.

**Phone.** 1 (800) 349-0297 is the confirmed business number
(CANONICAL_FACTS, founder 2026-08-23). Use it on directory listings that
require a phone. The marketing site still publishes **<support@dutiva.ca>**
only — `info@`, `hello@`, and `DutivaCanada@` are retired — unless a product
decision later adds the number to public copy.

**Address.** Ottawa for marketing and press contexts; the Toronto registered
office for legal and corporate contexts. Pick per the directory's purpose and
keep it consistent within that category.

## Tier 2 — Canadian associations and business bodies

Higher authority than generic directories and far more relevant to the
audience. Most charge membership; verify current cost and eligibility before
committing, and treat the directory listing as one benefit among several
rather than the reason to join.

- **Invest Ottawa** — regional ecosystem directory, relevant to the operating city.
- **Ottawa Board of Trade** and the **Ontario Chamber of Commerce** — local and provincial business listings.
- **Canadian Chamber of Commerce** — national.
- **HRPA** (Human Resources Professionals Association, Ontario), **CPHR Canada**, and the **Ordre des CRHA** in Quebec — the professional bodies your buyers belong to. Vendor or partner directories where they exist; their publications are also the best guest-post targets.
- **National Payroll Institute** — adjacent audience with real overlap on record-keeping and termination documentation.
- **BetaKit**, **Communitech**, **MaRS** — Canadian tech ecosystem coverage and directories.

The Quebec bodies matter disproportionately. Genuine French-language HR
content is scarce, the site already ships a full French corpus under `/fr`,
and a citation from a Quebec professional body is both easier to earn and less
contested than the equivalent in English.

## Tier 3 — Software review directories

G2, Capterra, GetApp, Software Advice, TrustRadius, and Trustpilot rank well for
comparison and alternatives queries, and answer engines lean on them heavily.

| Directory  | Status                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Trustpilot | Live at https://www.trustpilot.com/review/dutiva.ca — wired into `src/config/reviewDirectories.ts` (footer / trust strip / pricing). No rating badge until real reviews. |
| G2         | Profile submitted / claimed — set `reviewUrl` when the **public** product page is live.                                                                                  |
| Capterra   | Not claimed.                                                                                                                                                             |

**The honest constraint:** these are review-driven. A profile with no reviews
ranks poorly and converts worse. Keep profiles claimed and indexed, then pursue
reviews once there are paying customers with something real to say. **Never**
solicit or write reviews from people who have not used the product —
fabricated social proof is both a policy violation on every one of these
platforms and squarely against the "no fabricated metrics" rule in
CANONICAL_FACTS.

## Tier 4 — Earned coverage and guest contributions

The highest-value and slowest category. Publications worth approaching:
**Canadian HR Reporter**, **HRD Canada**, **Benefits Canada**, regional
business press in Ottawa and Toronto, and the association publications above.

What makes a pitch land here is a specific, useful angle rather than a company
announcement. The expanded articles are the raw material — each already
represents a defensible point of view:

| Article                          | Pitch angle                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ontario-termination-notice`     | Why termination clauses fail in Ontario, and the drafting habits behind it        |
| `employment-contract-clauses`    | The clauses Canadian employers borrow from US agreements that do not survive here |
| `quebec-employment-standards`    | Why an Ontario HR playbook misprices Quebec departures                            |
| `federally-regulated-workplaces` | The jurisdiction question most employers have never actually confirmed            |
| `duty-to-accommodate`            | Process failures, not accommodation costs, drive most adverse findings            |
| `employment-record-keeping`      | Retention obligations that pull in two directions at once                         |

The founder's operating background — a Canadian HR and payroll operator who
has processed payroll, prepared ROEs, and drafted termination letters across
federal and provincial standards — is the credibility hook, and it is real.
Attribute as **Martin Constantineau, Founder & CEO**, always in full.

## What is deliberately not on this list

**A public termination-notice calculator.** An earlier version of this advice
proposed one as a linkable asset. It is barred: publishing notice periods
would violate the editorial rule in `articleModel.ts`, which is enforced at
build time by `articles.test.ts` and exists precisely because a wrong
statutory figure on an answer-engine-indexed page gets quoted onward without
the disclaimer beside it. Any **public** linkable tool has to work without
publishing figures — a decision checklist or a jurisdiction-scoping
questionnaire would qualify; a figure-emitting calculator would not.

**Workspace entitlement calculators — eng complete (TODO.md EF11, 2026-08-24).**
Ontario notice, severance eligibility + amount, QC/FED hedge notice flows,
ROE / layoff / leave-return trackers ship under `/app/workflows/`. Public
figure-emitting calculators on `/tools/*` remain barred. Remaining EF11 items
need L6 sign-off or a product data decision — not unattended eng (see TODO.md
EF11 “Blocked” table).

**A jurisdiction-scoping questionnaire — built (D6, 2026-08-06).** Three
questions determine whether Ontario (ESA), Quebec (LNT), or federal (Canada
Labour Code) employment standards likely apply to an employee. No statutory
figures — it names the statute and links to the official text. Live at
`/tools/jurisdiction-check` (EN) and `/fr/outils/verification-juridiction`
(FR), prerendered and in the sitemap. This is the non-figure linkable asset
the playbook called for.

**Paid links and link exchanges.** Against Google's guidelines, and the risk
sits on the domain you are trying to build.

**Cold outbound at volume.** CASL governs any outbound campaign — opt-in
required, the burden of proving consent sits with the sender, penalties reach
into the millions. Individual, researched outreach to a named editor is a
different activity from a campaign and is what this playbook contemplates.

**Claims the product does not support.** Never "legally compliant" or
"guaranteed compliant"; never a launch date (both previously published dates
have passed — tie language to product state instead); never customer names
without written permission; never implied provincial coverage beyond Ontario,
Quebec, and the federal regime. Alberta and BC stay labelled roadmap.

## Measuring whether any of it worked

Search Console is the prerequisite and is verified (see `docs/TODO.md`
OA8). Bing Webmaster currently holds a `www.dutiva.ca` property — after the
apex redirect is confirmed live, add/verify the apex property and prefer it.

Once listings and articles are live, the metrics that matter are, in order:
number of distinct referring domains; impressions and average position for
the article URLs specifically, separated from the legal pages that currently
absorb the brand queries; and whether the commercial pages (`/`, `/pricing`,
`/templates`) begin surfacing for non-brand terms at all. Expect the first
movement in months, not weeks.

### Quarterly AI-answer probe (four engines)

Run this once a quarter. Query **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Perplexity**, and
**Microsoft Copilot** with the same prompts (incognito / no personalization).
Score each cell: mentioned / recommended / competitor-only / absent, and note
the category label the engine uses (HR software vs legal services).

| Buying stage   | Prompt (EN)                                                   | Prompt (FR)                                                                |

| Decision       | Is Dutiva good for Quebec employment standards documentation? | Dutiva convient-il pour la documentation des normes du travail au Québec ? |

Log results in a private sheet (date, engine, prompt, outcome, cited URL,
competitor named). Do not invent scores in the repo.

On-site, the homepage FAQ, `/faq` “Choosing and getting started” group,
`/about` company facts, the `/vs/*` “larger libraries” FAQ, and the
`llms.txt` Common questions section are written to match those buyer
prompts. Wikipedia, Reddit, and news citations remain outreach — see Tier 3
and Tier 4 above. Trustpilot is claimed; G2 still needs a public product URL
before the marketing site can link it.

### Citation → session attribution

When a listing or guest post can take a link, use:

`https://dutiva.ca/<path>?utm_source=<publisher>&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=authority_<yyyyqq>`

GA4 (`VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`, consent-gated) is the session sink. CRM
attribution for inbound demos stays manual until a CRM is wired — paste the
landing URL + `utm_*` into the opportunity notes.

## Open items

1. Confirm `www.dutiva.ca` → `https://dutiva.ca` 308 after the next production
   deploy (Vercel Domains: www assigned, not primary without redirect). Then
   prefer the apex property in Bing Webmaster Tools.
2. Add the public Bing Places and Apple Maps URLs to Organization `sameAs`
   (and `/about`) once they can be opened without signing in. Crunchbase is
   still unclaimed. Company LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google Maps are already
   wired.
3. Run the quarterly four-engine probe and store scores outside the repo.
