/**
 * End-to-end smoke layer. It runs the production build (scripts/build → dist/)
 * behind e2e/serve-dist.mjs, which mirrors the Vercel routing contract, and
 * drives it in a real Chromium. Deliberately small and hermetic: no live
 * Supabase, no third-party calls — every assertion is about what the shipped
 * bundle does on its own (routing, prerender + hydration, the consent gate).
 *
 * Chromium resolution differs by host. This Claude execution environment ships
 * a browser at /opt/pw-browsers; GitHub Actions does not and installs its own
 * with `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`. Point at the preinstalled
 * binary only when it exists, so one config runs unchanged in both places.
