/**
 * First-line self-service assist for the intake forms: before a request is
 * sent, surface the Help Centre articles most likely to answer it, so simple
 * questions are deflected instead of becoming tickets.
 *
 * The safety-critical half is the escalation policy. Some matters are ALWAYS
 * handled by a person and are never auto-answered — privacy, security,
 * accessibility, complaints, billing disputes, and account recovery. For those
 * categories this returns no suggestions and signals `escalate`, so the UI can
 * set that expectation plainly. This is retrieval-only (no generative model),
 * which is deliberate: the public intake is unauthenticated, and a generated
 * "answer" to a compliance question carries cost, abuse, and accuracy risk. A
 * future generative first-line would plug in HERE, behind auth + rate limits,
 * and must keep this same escalation gate.
