/**
 * Content model for guided flows — the surface Ring 2's interactive tools
 * needed and the product did not have (docs/FOUR_RING_FRAMEWORK.md).
 *
 * Document Studio renders a linear question set into merge-field blocks. That
 * covers a document you already know you are writing; it cannot express
 * "receive disclosure → assess → explore options → implement → document",
 * where what you are asked next depends on what you just said. `ClauseGate`
 * gates a block on jurisdiction, headcount and union — never on an answer —
 * so branching had nowhere to live.
 *
 * A flow is a graph of steps. Several shapes fall out of the same structure,
 * which is why this is one engine rather than several:
 *
 *   - a **checklist** is a chain of `task` steps with one exit each;
 *   - a **decision tree** is `choice` steps whose options name the next step;
 *   - a **numeric input** is an `input` step that routes from a typed integer
 *     (e.g. completed months of tenure) via `resolve`;
 *   - a **guided worksheet** mixes the above and ends at an `outcome`;
 *   - a **scored assessment** is `choice` steps whose options carry a `value`
 *     and share a destination, ending at a `result` that bands the total.
 *
 * Flows produce a record, not a document. A completed run summarises the path
 * taken and hands off to the Document Studio template that makes it official
 * (`outcome.documents`, or the band's on a scored run). Keeping the two
 * separate is deliberate: the flow is how you decide, the template is what
 * you send.
