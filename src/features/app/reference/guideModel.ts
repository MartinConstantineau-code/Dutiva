/**
 * Content model for in-product reference guides — the second surface Ring 2
 * needed and the product did not have (docs/FOUR_RING_FRAMEWORK.md).
 *
 * Eight of the framework's remaining tools are reference documents: the EAP
 * referral guide, the manager conversation guide, the functional limitations
 * guide, the pay-stub explainer, and so on. None of them fit anywhere. The
 * Knowledge view held titles and tags with no bodies; Document Studio
 * generates documents rather than publishing them; and the public `/guides`
 * collection is editorial, bound by a rule against stating statutory figures
 * that a working reference for an HR operator cannot live under.
 *
 * So this is deliberately **not** `articleModel.ts`, even though the block
 * structure is similar. Different reader, different rules:
 *
 *   - it is in-product and behind the app, not indexed;
 *   - it carries per-jurisdiction notes, because the reader has a jurisdiction;
 *   - it links to the templates and flows that act on it, because the reader
 *     is mid-task rather than browsing.
 *
 * What it is not: a place for statutory figures that go stale. The same
 * caution the editorial rule exists for applies here — name the statute,
 * describe the shape of the rule, and send the reader to the official text.
 * The difference is that here it is a judgement call rather than a test.
