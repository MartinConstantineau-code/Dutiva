/**
 * Paginated reads for PostgREST selects. Hosted Supabase silently caps an
 * un-ranged select at max_rows (1000) — no error, just a truncated result —
 * so a single .select() over a growing table is a latent truncation bug:
 * an org past the cap would have its compliance score computed from an
 * arbitrary slice of its rows (and the write-on-read snapshot would persist
 * that wrong number over the scheduled job's correct one). Every list the
 * score is computed from reads through this instead. The snapshot edge
 * function carries its own copy of the same loop (record-score-snapshots/
 * index.ts) — it cannot import across the runtime boundary.
