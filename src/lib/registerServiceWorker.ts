 * `vite dev` and in tests (import.meta.env.PROD === false). Registration is
 * deferred to the load event so it never competes with first paint, and
 * updateViaCache:'none' makes the browser revalidate sw.js against the network
 * on each navigation rather than serving it from the HTTP cache — so a
 * redeployed worker is picked up promptly. A failed registration is swallowed:
 * offline support is an enhancement and must never break the live app.

/**
 * When a replacement worker takes control of this already-open tab (a new
 * deploy activated and called clients.claim()), reload once so the page
 * re-renders against the new worker with fresh, per-route HTML — instead of
 * leaving the tab on whatever the superseded worker had served until the user
 * manually hard-refreshes (the "content looks stale / doubled until I force a
 * refresh" symptom this recovers from).
 *
 * Exported for tests; registerServiceWorker wires it to the real
 * navigator.serviceWorker + window.location in production browsers only.
 *
 * Guards, in order:
 *  - Nothing was controlling this load (`hadController` false): a first-visit
 *    install's initial claim, or a hard reload (worker bypassed) — either way
 *    already the freshest load, with nothing stale to escape. Also means the
 *    reload only ever fires for an *update* replacing a running worker.
 *  - The app surface (`/app*`): workspace drafts — the Advisor composer text,
 *    a half-filled new-case form — live only in React state, so reloading
 *    would silently discard unsent work. The stale-content symptom this fixes
 *    was on the public marketing pages, which hold no such unsaved state, so
 *    recovery is limited to them. Read at takeover time so a client-side
 *    navigation into /app is respected.
 *  - `reloaded` latch: one reload per page load, so it can never loop.
