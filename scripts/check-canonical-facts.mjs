/**
 * Canonical-facts drift check — the half that reads stylesheets.
 *
 * `docs/CANONICAL_FACTS.md` is the source of record for Dutiva's load-bearing
 * facts, and it states its own precedence rule: where it disagrees with the
 * code, the code wins and the file gets corrected. Enforcement is split in two
 * along a principled line:
 *
 *   1. `src/canonicalFacts.test.ts` — rows backed by **TypeScript values**
 *      (template count, plan prices, jurisdictions, billing ratio, beta flag,
 *      coverage audit date, retired contact addresses). Those are imported and
 *      compared directly, which is what a test does well.
 *   2. THIS SCRIPT — rows backed by **CSS text** (the brand palette). Vitest
 *      runs with `css: false` (vite.config.ts), which stubs every `.css` file
 *      to an empty string — `?raw` included — so a test physically cannot read
 *      a token value. Turning that off to check two rows would slow the whole
 *      suite, so the stylesheet comparison lives here instead.
 *
 * Why the brand rows are worth enforcing at all: CANONICAL_FACTS §6 records
 * that the *written description* of the accent colour had already drifted once
 * (amber #E8A020 for gold #d4af37) while the logo kit stayed correct. A hex in
 * a document is exactly the kind of fact that gets copied into a deck and
 * outlives the value it described.
 *
 * Dependency-free on purpose, matching check-migrations.mjs.

 * stop at `#0a1522` (a gradient stop already in patterns.css) or swapping the
 * gold and navy rows outright would both stay green. Each row is compared as
 * an exact set against the declarations it actually names, so a value that
 * moves to a different meaning fails even though the hex still exists.
 *
