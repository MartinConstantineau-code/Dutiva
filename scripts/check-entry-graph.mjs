/**
 * Post-build budget on the **eager entry graph** — what a first-time visitor
 * to a public page downloads before anything is interactive: the entry script
 * plus every `<link rel="modulepreload">` the build put in the HTML.
 *
 * Why this exists as a build step rather than a note. The workspace is
 * route-split and every view is `lazy()`, so the split *looks* right in the
 * source and drifts silently in the output: one non-lazy import from a module
 * the router already touches drags its whole transitive tree onto the
 * marketing critical path. That is exactly what had happened by 2026-08 —
 * `routes.tsx` → `appViews.tsx` → `ModeGate` → `navConfig` → `@/data` put
 * 113kB of demo HR fixtures, and the `vendor` group put a 157kB Markdown
 * parser, in front of a landing page. Nothing failed, because nothing looked.
 *
 * Membership is read from the build's own source maps, not by grepping the
 * minified output for telltale strings: `'Northgate Logistics Inc.'` is both a
 * fixture value and the text of a settings message, so a string match cannot
 * tell "the fixtures are eager" from "a sentence about them is".
 *
 * The numeric ceilings are a ratchet, not a target. Going over is not
 * automatically wrong — but it should be a decision someone writes down here,
 * not a diff nobody noticed. Byte counts are **raw, uncompressed**: this
 * measures what the build put on the critical path, not what a particular
 * CDN's encoder achieves on it.

const MAX_EAGER_KB = 420 // 612 as of 2026-09-06; 620 as of 2026-09-06 for the browser-local Transformer option (ruleSuggestionAi.ts controller + a few new workspace i18n strings). 630 as of 2026-09-06 because Vercel's production build is consistently ~6-7 kB larger than local builds, and the latest deployment measured 623.4 kB raw. 645 as of 2026-09-08: post-governance modules (security, operations, specialists, revenue, CRM, Comms segments) added shell nav labels that ride the eager graph via navLabels.ts; Vercel measured 637.0 kB raw on main. 650 as of 2026-09-20: finance bank-item triage added ~20 bilingual strings (selection, bulk actions, exception labels) to the eager messages-workspace bundle; Vercel measured 645.1 kB raw on main. 575 as of 2026-09-20 (downward ratchet): the vendor group's regex test was replaced by per-segment package matching plus computed dependency closures for the transformers/recharts trees — evicting leaked zod (~50kB), onnxruntime-common, redux, redux-thunk and nested-dep copies; local build now measures 555.2 kB raw. The ~40 MB model and ONNX runtime stay in a lazy chunk, not the entry graph. 420 as of 2026-09-20 (downward ratchet): vendor became a whitelist of the eager runtime core (react, react-dom, router, scheduler, web-vitals) so ~175 lucide modules and every other lazy-only dependency follow their importers; the marketing message catalogue split into scoped lazy chunks behind LangScope (seoMeta + common + landing chrome/footer stay eager at ~6 kB, the rest rides per-page chunks). Local build measures 387.9 kB raw; Vercel should land ~394 kB.
