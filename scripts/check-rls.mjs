/**
 * RLS regression guard.
 *
 * On 2026-08-08 an audit found three tables that the anonymous PostgREST role
 * could read in full — beta_signups (every waitlist email), hr_documents, and
 * signatures — because a world-open `using (true)` SELECT policy had been
 * applied straight to the database with no migration behind it. Migration 0073
 * closed the holes. Nothing, though, would have caught them: the schema in the
 * repo looked correct, every test passed, and the only evidence was rows coming
 * back from a request nobody in CI was making.
 *
 * This script makes that request. As the anonymous role — the same role an
 * unauthenticated browser uses — it reads each table that must never expose
 * rows to the public and fails if any of them do. It is the runtime mirror of
 * check-migrations.mjs: that one asks whether the database's migration history
 * matches the repo, this one asks whether the database's actual access control
 * matches what we believe it to be, which a migration file cannot prove because
 * a policy can be changed out-of-band exactly as this one was.
 *
 * Two things make the check trustworthy rather than merely green:
 *
 *   - A POSITIVE CONTROL. An expired or malformed anon key makes PostgREST
 *     answer 401 to everything, which would otherwise read as "every table is
 *     locked down — pass". So we first confirm the key can read a table that is
 *     meant to be public (service_status). If that read fails, the key or the
 *     endpoint is wrong and every negative result below is meaningless, so we
 *     error out instead of reporting a false all-clear.
 *   - LOUD SKIPPING. With no credentials the check cannot run; on GitHub Actions
 *     that skip is announced as a warning annotation and a job-summary entry so
 *     a green check is never mistaken for a verified one — the same discipline
 *     check-migrations.mjs uses.
 *
 * Dependency-free on purpose: Node's global fetch only, so this cannot rot
 * behind a package upgrade, and it needs only the PUBLIC anon key (safe to hold
 * as a repository variable) plus the project URL.
