/**
 * Migration integrity + drift check.
 *
 * Three features have now shipped inert because nothing compared what the repo
 * contains against what the project has actually applied:
 *
 *   - 0019_client_error_reports was never applied, so `report-error` posted
 *     crash reports to a table and RPC that did not exist. The README
 *     documented the feature as live.
 *   - The CHECK constraints on ai_telemetry_events never learned the
 *     vocabulary the edge functions write, so support-firstline's rate limit
 *     counted rows Postgres refused to store and never fired once.
 *   - advisor-safety-event returned 500 on every call for the same reason.
 *
 * Each was invisible: the code was merged, CI was green, and the failure only
 * showed up as an absence. This script makes that class of failure loud.
 *
 * Two halves, deliberately separable:
 *
 *   1. LOCAL (always runs, no credentials) — filename discipline. Catches a
 *      duplicated or malformed sequence number before it becomes an ordering
 *      ambiguity between two developers' branches.
 *   2. DRIFT (runs only when credentials are present) — every local migration
 *      compared against supabase_migrations.schema_migrations on the real
 *      project. Skips cleanly on forks and local checkouts rather than failing
 *      them, so it is safe in `npm run check`.
 *
 * Drift needs SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN (a personal access token) and
 * SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF. In CI, add them as repository secrets and the step
 * starts enforcing on its own — no code change needed. Until they exist the
 * drift half skips, and on GitHub Actions that skip is announced as a warning
 * annotation and a job-summary entry so a green check is never mistaken for a
 * verified one (see announceSkippedDriftCheck).
 *
 * Dependency-free on purpose: Node's global fetch only, so this cannot rot
 * behind a package upgrade.
