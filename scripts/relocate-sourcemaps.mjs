/**
 * Move client source maps out of dist/ after `vite build`.
 *
 * build.sourcemap is 'hidden' (vite.config.ts): the .map files are emitted so
 * production error-report stack traces can be symbolicated, but the JS carries
 * no `sourceMappingURL` comment, so nothing auto-fetches them. Serving the maps
 * from dist/ would still expose the unminified source to anyone who guesses the
 * URL, so this step relocates every dist/**\/*.map into sourcemaps/<rev>/
 * (git-ignored) BEFORE the service worker precaches dist/assets and before
 * dist/ is deployed.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this local dir is NOT a durable artifact. The deploy build (on
 * Vercel) discards everything outside the deployed output, so to symbolicate a
 * production trace the DEPLOY pipeline must archive sourcemaps/<rev>/ to private
 * storage keyed by the release SHA before its workspace is torn down (see
 * docs/ERROR_REPORTING.md → Source maps). Do not rely on rebuilding to
 * reproduce them: the client bundle bakes in build-time env values
 * (__RELEASE_SHA__) and preview builds add extra transforms, so an exact
 * rebuild is not guaranteed without replicating the original build environment.
 *
 * Runs in the `npm run build` pipeline between `vite build` and `build:ssr`.
